# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- **High-Frequency Background Location Tracking:**
  - Implemented a robust, "Uber-like" tracking solution using `expo-location` and `expo-task-manager`.
  - **Android Foreground Service:** Enabled to ensure persistent background operation (Android 8+).
  - **Optimized Configuration:** Tuned for fleet monitoring (5s interval, 10m distance, `AutomotiveNavigation` activity type).
  - **Redundancy:** Includes a 15-minute background fetch heartbeat to restart services if killed by the OS.
  - **API Integration:** Reliably posts location updates to `/user/geolocation`.
  - **State Management:** Centralized logic in `LocationContext` (`contexts/LocationContext.tsx`) managing both foreground UI updates and background server syncing.
- **Modernized Job Page Layout:**
  - Refactored the `app/job/[id].tsx` page to use the standardized `Card` component for all sections, creating a consistent and modern layout.
  - Removed old card styles from child components (`JobStatus`, `JobProxy`, etc.) to prevent style conflicts and improve code maintainability.
- **Standardized App Theme:**
  - Created a custom theme in `app/_layout.tsx` to ensure consistent header and background colors across all screens, fully supporting both light and dark modes.
  - Set the header background to white in light mode and a dark gray in dark mode.
  - Set the page background to a light gray in light mode and a darker gray in dark mode.
- **Fixed Layout Inconsistencies:**
  - Removed horizontal padding from the main `ScrollView` in `app/dashboard/account/index.tsx` to allow the background color to span the full width of the screen, matching other pages.
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy:**
  - Changed the background color of the light theme to a light gray (`#f0f0f0`) in `constants/Colors.ts`.
  - Updated the `Card.tsx` component to use the `card` color from the theme, which is now white (`#ffffff`) in light mode. This creates a clear distinction between the page background and the cards.
- **Deposits Page Redesign:**
  - The deposits list page (`app/dashboard/account/deposits/index.tsx`) has been successfully redesigned to use a modern, card-based layout.
  - Each deposit is now rendered as a tappable, theme-aware `Card`.
  - The new design incorporates `MaterialIcons` for better readability and a more intuitive user experience.
- Memory Bank core file structure has been initialized.
- `projectbrief.md` populated with core requirements and project goals based on user input.
- `productContext.md` populated with problem statement, proposed solution, how it works, and user experience goals based on user input.
- `systemPatterns.md` populated with initial system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths based on user input and project structure.
- `techContext.md` populated with technologies used, development setup, initial technical constraints, and tool usage patterns based on user input and `README.md`.
- Updated `components/job/JobFiles.tsx` to replace `TouchableOpacity` with `PrimaryButton` in the image viewing modal and to display images in a gallery format.
- **Job Comment Functionality:** Implemented view, add, edit, and delete capabilities for job comments.
  - Created `CommentItem.tsx`, `CommentModal.tsx`, `CommentsList.tsx`.
  - Integrated into `app/job/[id].tsx`.
  - Added `JobComment` type to `types.ts`.
  - Refactored `CommentsList.tsx` to use `map` instead of `FlatList` to prevent nested VirtualizedList issues.
  - Enhanced comments section in `app/job/[id].tsx` to be collapsible.
  - Added client-side pagination to `CommentsList.tsx`.
- **User Data Fetching Architecture:**
  - Migrated user data (`/users/me`) fetching logic from `UserContext.tsx` to `AuthContext.tsx`.
  - `AuthContext.tsx` now manages `currentUser` state and `isUserLoading` state, fetching user data directly when a session is active and `apiService` is configured.
  - `UserContext.tsx` is simplified, focusing on non-authentication-related user state like `isClockedIn`.
  - Components consuming `currentUser` (e.g., `app/job/[id].tsx`) were updated to use `useAuth()`.
  - This architectural change resolves previous race conditions related to user data fetching and API readiness signaling.
- **Comment Item UI Update:**
  - Modified `components/job/CommentItem.tsx` to replace text-based edit/delete buttons with smaller, iconic `MaterialIcons` buttons (`edit`, `delete`).
  - Ensured icons use appropriate theme-aware colors.
  - Resolved associated TypeScript errors by correcting `User` type import and using `buttonVariants.error` for delete icon color.
- **Job Cancellation Dialog UI Update (in `components/job/JobStatus.tsx`):**
  - Adjusted button layout for "Go Back" and "Cancel Job" to be space-between justified (left/right alignment).
  - Updated "Go Back" button to a standard `OutlinedButton` for neutral styling.
  - Ensured "Cancel Job" (destructive) button retains its error styling.
  - Removed full-width properties from individual buttons in the dialog.
- **Comments Section Refactor:**
  - Extracted comments functionality from `app/job/[id].tsx` into a new dedicated component: `components/job/JobComments.tsx`.
  - This new component now manages its own state, handlers, and JSX for displaying comments, the comment modal, and related actions.
  - `app/job/[id].tsx` has been simplified by removing the direct comments logic and now renders the `JobComments` component.
- **Proxy management functionality:**
  - Created `JobProxy.tsx` component to allow technicians to view/edit active proxy connections.
  - This component is integrated into the job details page and allows for easy management of proxy connections.
  - Includes new phone form to add new phone numbers to the list of customer phone numbers included in the `CustomerPhones` array within the `Customer` object for each `Job`.
- **File uploads functionality:**
  - Created `JobFiles.tsx` component to handle file uploads for job-related documents.
  - Integrated file upload UI into the job details page.
  - Implemented file preview and removal functionality.
  - Video playback support not yet implemented.
- **Theming Strategy Documentation:**
  - Reviewed `components/job/CommentModal.tsx` to understand its light/dark mode styling.
  - Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to include a comprehensive section on the app's theming strategy. This includes how to get the current theme, use themed base components, apply theme colors to standard components using `useThemeColor` and its helper functions, and the importance of consistency. This documented pattern is now the standard for all components.
- **Editable Customer Information:**
  - Implemented editing for Customer Name, Customer Email, Service Address, and Car details within `components/job/CustomerInfo.tsx`.
  - Created `EditNameModal.tsx`, `EditEmailModal.tsx`, `EditAddressModal.tsx`, and `EditCarModal.tsx` in `components/job/modals/`.
  - Updated `Car` type in `types.ts` for `vin` to be `string | null`.
  - Integrated modals and API save logic (including for email) into `CustomerInfo.tsx`. Service Address updates now use `PATCH /jobs/:id` with the full job object.
  - Ensured `fetchJob` prop is correctly passed and typed through `JobDetailsAndMapButtons.tsx`.
  - Adhered to theming guidelines for all new UI, including ensuring full-width text inputs in `EditNameModal` and `EditEmailModal` for consistency.
- **Comment Item Condensed Layout:**
  - Updated `components/job/CommentItem.tsx` to reduce padding, margins, font sizes, and line heights for a more compact appearance.
  - Corrected the import path for the `User` type in `components/job/CommentItem.tsx` from `contexts/AuthContext` to `types`, resolving a TypeScript error.
- **Card Component Standardization:**
  - Relocated `Card.tsx` to `components/Card.tsx` (from `components/common/`).
  - Refactored `Card.tsx` for consistent theming: uses page background, theme-aware border, and theme-aware shadow (new `shadow` color added to `constants/Colors.ts`).
  - Standardized `Card` usage in `app/dashboard/create-job.tsx` by replacing local card styles.
  - Updated `app/dashboard/account.tsx` to use the new `Card` import and ensured its internal text elements are themed correctly.
  - Ensured `LabelText` in `components/Typography.tsx` uses themed text color.
- **Discounts Feature Refactor (Vue-inspired):**
  - Added `ApiDiscountCode` and `NewDiscountData` to `types.ts`.
  - Created `components/job/DiscountList.tsx` for displaying discounts and handling removals.
  - Created `components/job/modals/DiscountFormModal.tsx` for adding discounts (fixed, percent, code-based) with API fetching for codes and validation.
  - Refactored `components/job/Discounts.tsx` to integrate the new list and modal components, calculate totals, and manage API interactions. It now uses the standard `Card` component.
- **Custom Address Autocompletion (using `expo-crypto`):**
  - Uninstalled `uuid` and `@types/uuid`. Installed `expo-crypto`.
  - Updated `app/dashboard/create-job.tsx` to use `Crypto.randomUUID()` for session tokens.
  - Custom implementation for Google Places Autocomplete and Details APIs using `fetch` and a `View` with `.map()` for suggestions is in place.
  - Changed Service `DropDownPicker`'s `listMode` to `'MODAL'` to address nested VirtualizedList warning.
- **DateTimePicker Refactor for Job Creation (Android Stability):**
  - The `DateTimePicker` in `app/dashboard/create-job.tsx` was refactored to use the imperative `DateTimePickerAndroid.open()` API for Android.
  - This involves a two-step process for Android users: selecting the date, then selecting the time, with separate handlers (`handleAndroidDateChange`, `handleAndroidTimeChange`).
  - The iOS implementation remains a single declarative `DateTimePicker` with `mode="datetime"`.
  - This change, mirroring the pattern in `components/job/ArrivalTime.tsx`, is intended to resolve the "Cannot read property 'dismiss' of undefined" error on Android by providing a more stable interaction with the native date/time pickers.
- **Background Location Tracking:**
  - Implemented background location tracking using `expo-task-manager`.
  - Installed `expo-task-manager`.
  - Modified `hooks/useLocation.ts` to define a background task (`background-location-task`) for sending location updates, updated permission requests for background access, and switched from `watchPositionAsync` to `startLocationUpdatesAsync` and `stopLocationUpdatesAsync`.
  - Ensured `app.json` was already correctly configured for background location.
- **Styling Refactor for Login/Registration Pages:**
  - Updated `styles/globalStyles.ts` with new theme-aware input styles (`themedFormInput`, `themedPasswordInputWrapper`, `themedPasswordTextInput`) and made `inputContainer` background transparent. Removed old/unused input styles.
  - Refactored `app/login.tsx` and `app/register.tsx` to use these new global styles, ensuring consistent structure and theming for input fields.
- **User Registration Feature:**
  - Created `app/register.tsx` with a complete registration form.
  - Implemented client-side validation (required fields, password match, strong password).
  - Integrated with `POST /users/signup` API endpoint.
  - Redirects to login page with email autofill on successful registration.
  - Added navigation links between login and registration pages.
  - Ensured consistent light/dark mode theming.
  - Arranged First Name and Last Name fields on the same row.
  - Added to root `_layout.tsx` with `headerShown: false`.
- **Login Page Updates (`app/login.tsx`):**
  - Enabled email autofill from registration.
  - Added link to the registration page.
  - Improved theming consistency.
  - Standardized password visibility toggle state and function names to match `app/register.tsx` (`isPasswordVisible`, `togglePasswordVisibility`).
- **Enhanced Job File Uploads with Camera Integration:**
  - Installed `expo-camera` dependency.
  - Created `components/job/CameraCaptureModal.tsx` for direct photo capture.
  - Modified `components/job/JobFiles.tsx` to include separate icon buttons for camera and file picker, integrating the new camera modal.
  - Removed all code comments from `components/job/CameraCaptureModal.tsx` and `components/job/JobFiles.tsx`.
  - Updated `app.json` with the `expo-camera` plugin to handle camera permissions.
- **Lost Password Page:**
  - Installed `react-native-webview` dependency.
  - Created `app/lost-password.tsx` screen with a `WebView` for the password reset URL.
  - Added a "Back to Login" button on the `lost-password` screen.
  - Added a "Forgot Password?" link on `app/login.tsx` to navigate to the new screen.
  - Integrated the `lost-password` screen into the main navigation stack in `app/_layout.tsx`.
- **Phone Number Formatting (Registration Page):**
  - Added `formatPhoneNumber` utility to `utils/strings.ts` for `XXX-XXX-XXXX` formatting.
  - Integrated into `app/register.tsx` phone input for real-time formatting and set `maxLength={12}`.
- **Account Deletion Request:**
    - Added a "Delete Account" button to the account screen (`app/dashboard/account/index.tsx`).
    - Implemented a custom confirmation modal (`components/account/DeleteAccountModal.tsx`) that requires the user to type "delete" to confirm.
    - The button triggers the modal, and upon confirmation, a `DELETE` request is sent to `/account/delete`.
    - The user is notified of the request's success or failure via an alert.
    - The user is now logged out and redirected to the login screen after a 1-second delay for a smoother user experience.
- **Dashboard Job List Refactor (`app/dashboard/index.tsx`):**
  - Improved the layout and production readiness of the main jobs screen.
  - Created a new reusable `JobsFilter.tsx` component under `components/dashboard/` to abstract the filter and sort dropdowns.
  - Migrated all related logic, state, and styling for the filters into the new component.
  - Corrected TypeScript prop types in `JobsFilter.tsx` for state setters.
  - Simplified `app/dashboard/index.tsx` by removing the now-redundant filter code and using the new `JobsFilter` component, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable implementation.
- **In-App Notification Center:**
  - Implemented a full-featured in-app notification system.
  - **Configuration:** Added `expo-notifications` plugin to `app.json`.
  - **Core Logic:** Created `hooks/useNotifications.ts` to manage permissions, listeners, and saving notifications to `AsyncStorage`.
  - **State Management:** Created `contexts/NotificationsContext.tsx` to provide app-wide access to notifications, unread counts, and management functions.
  - **UI Components:**
    - Created `components/dashboard/NotificationBell.tsx` to display a bell icon with an unread count badge in the header.
    - Created `app/dashboard/notifications.tsx` as a dedicated screen to view notification history.
  - **Integration:**
    - The `NotificationsProvider` and `useNotifications` hook are initialized in the root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`).
    - The `NotificationBell` is added to the header on the main dashboard screen, and the "Add Job" button was moved to the left side of the header for better layout.
- **Standardized "My Jobs" Page Layout:**
  - Refactored `app/dashboard/index.tsx` to use a `ScrollView` and `Card` component, aligning its structure with other pages like "My Account" for visual consistency.
- **Fixed Video Recording:**
  - Addressed a bug in `components/job/CameraCaptureModal.tsx` where video recording would lock the UI.
  - The `handleCapture` function was refactored to use a non-blocking promise-based approach for `recordAsync()`.
  - This ensures the UI remains responsive, recording can be started and stopped correctly, and proper loading states are displayed.
- **Standardized "Create Job" Page Layout:**
  - Refactored `app/dashboard/create-job.tsx` to add consistent padding to the main container.
  - Wrapped the page in a `SafeAreaView` to prevent the tab navigator from obscuring content at the bottom of the screen.
  - Added a back button to the header of the `create-job` screen in `app/dashboard/_layout.tsx`.
  - Reduced the font size of the `CardTitle` component in `components/Typography.tsx` to make the titles less prominent.
  - This change aligns the page's layout with other screens, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
- **Added Loading Spinner to File Viewer:**
  - Updated `components/job/JobFiles.tsx` to display a loading spinner (`ActivityIndicator`) in the `FileViewerModal` while images or videos are loading.
  - Added an `isLoading` state to the modal.
  - Used `onLoadStart` and `onLoadEnd` for the `Image` component.
  - Used a `useEffect` hook to monitor the `player.status` for the `Video` component.
- **Camera Flash Control:**
  - Added a flash control button to the `CameraCaptureModal`.
  - Implemented state management to cycle through flash modes ('on', 'off', 'auto') for photos.
  - Implemented torch functionality for video recording.
  - The selected flash/torch mode is now applied to the `CameraView` using the `flash` and `enableTorch` props.
- **Single Deposit Page Layout Standardization:**
  - Refactored `app/dashboard/account/deposits/[id].tsx` to improve styling consistency.
  - Replaced custom local styles with standardized `HeaderText` and `LabelText` typography components.
  - Wrapped all content sections in `Card` components to align with the app's visual structure.
  - Standardized page padding for a uniform look and feel.
- **Fixed Customer Name Update Bug:**
  - Modified `components/job/modals/EditNameModal.tsx` to use separate "First Name" and "Last Name" input fields.
  - The modal now correctly parses the full name on open and passes a `{ firstName, lastName }` object to the `onSave` handler.
  - Updated `components/job/CustomerInfo.tsx` to send this object to the backend, resolving the API mismatch and fixing the bug.
- **Fixed Notifications Screen Crash:**
  - Resolved a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error on the notifications screen after a second attempt.
  - The initial fix using `useCallback` was insufficient due to a circular dependency.
  - The final, robust fix involved refactoring the `markAsRead` and `markAllAsRead` functions in `NotificationsContext.tsx` to use the functional update form of `setState`.
  - This removed the `notifications` state dependency from the `useCallback` hooks, making the function references truly stable and definitively breaking the infinite re-render loop.
- **Implemented Pull-to-Refresh on Job Details Page:**
  - Added `RefreshControl` to the `ScrollView` in `app/job/[id].tsx`.
  - Implemented the `onRefresh` handler to refetch job data.
  - Added `refreshing` state to manage the refresh indicator.
- **Push Notification Subscription:**
  - The app now correctly prompts users for notification permissions after they log in.
  - The device's push token is successfully sent to and registered with the backend.
  - The logout process was also fixed to prevent crashes on simulators and ensure smooth operation.
- **Push Notification Deep Linking:**
  - Implemented functionality to navigate users to a specific screen when they tap a push notification.
  - The `hooks/useNotifications.ts` file now contains logic to parse a `link` from the notification's data payload and use `expo-router` to navigate to it.
  - The deep link format is `phoenix-mobile:///job/[JOB_ID]`.
- **In-App Notification Deep Linking:**
  - Extended deep linking to the in-app notification list on the `app/dashboard/notifications.tsx` screen.
  - Notifications in the list are now tappable and will navigate to the associated link, providing a consistent experience with push notifications.
- **Job Acceptance Screen:**
  - Created a new screen at `app/actions/accept-job/[jobId].tsx` to allow technicians to accept or decline dispatched jobs.
  - The screen fetches job details and displays information conditionally based on the job's status.
  - Implemented API calls to accept (`POST /jobs/:id/accept`) and decline (`POST /jobs/:id/decline`) jobs.
  - On acceptance, the user is navigated to the job details page.
  - On decline, the user is redirected to the main dashboard.
  - The screen is fully theme-aware and uses the project's standard component library.
- **Email Paycheck Feature:**
  - Added an email icon button to each paycheck item on the `app/dashboard/account/paychecks/index.tsx` screen.
  - Implemented the `handleEmailPaycheck` function to call the `POST /paychecks/:paycheckId/email` endpoint.
  - Added loading and feedback (success/error alerts) to the user interface.
- **Background Fetch Heartbeat:**
  - Implemented a resilient "heartbeat" mechanism for location tracking using `expo-background-fetch`.
  - A background task runs approximately every 15 minutes to check the system state.
  - If the user is clocked in but location services have stopped (e.g., due to OS suspension), the task automatically restarts the location updates.
  - This ensures consistent fleet monitoring even if the app is killed or suspended by the operating system.

## What's Left to Build

- **Refine `systemPatterns.md`:**
  - Verify API communication details by reviewing `utils/api.ts`.
  - Confirm styling approach by inspecting component files.
  - Detail offline support strategy if any.
  - Verify HOC usage.
  - Detail API error handling and form handling patterns by reviewing relevant code.
  - Verify the exact screen for listing jobs.
- **Refine `techContext.md`:**
  - Specify Node.js version if a strict requirement exists.
  - Detail any specific IDE extensions or configurations beyond standard ESLint.
  - Clarify minimum OS version support if known.
  - Document performance targets or known limitations.
  - List any critical constraints from the backend API.
- **Populate `Known Issues`:** Document any existing bugs or known problems with the application.

## Current Status

- Memory Bank core files have been initialized and populated with initial project information.
- Further refinement and detail are needed in several sections, particularly `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`, requiring code review and potentially more specific user input.
- The Memory Bank provides a foundational understanding of the project.

## Known Issues

- **High Battery Usage:** The "Uber-like" tracking frequency (5s intervals) will consume significantly more battery than standard tracking. This is an expected trade-off for fleet monitoring functionality.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Android Foreground Service:** Initially disabled due to crashes, we have re-enabled it as a critical requirement for persistent background tracking on modern Android versions. We addressed the stability issues by ensuring proper cleanup of stale tasks before restarting services.
