# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- Memory Bank core file structure has been initialized.
- `projectbrief.md` populated with core requirements and project goals based on user input.
- `productContext.md` populated with problem statement, proposed solution, how it works, and user experience goals based on user input.
- `systemPatterns.md` populated with initial system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths based on user input and project structure.
- `techContext.md` populated with technologies used, development setup, initial technical constraints, and tool usage patterns based on user input and `README.md`.
- Updated `components/job/JobFiles.tsx` to replace `TouchableOpacity` with `PrimaryButton` in the image viewing modal and to display images in a gallery format.
- **Job Comment Functionality:** Implemented view, add, edit, and delete capabilities for job comments.
  - Created `CommentItem.tsx`, `CommentModal.tsx`, `CommentsList.tsx`.
  - Integrated into `app/job/[id].tsx`.
  - Added `JobComment` type to `types.ts`.
  - Refactored `CommentsList.tsx` to use `map` instead of `FlatList` to prevent nested VirtualizedList issues.
  - Enhanced comments section in `app/job/[id].tsx` to be collapsible.
  - Added client-side pagination to `CommentsList.tsx`.
- **User Data Fetching Architecture:**
    - Migrated user data (`/users/me`) fetching logic from `UserContext.tsx` to `AuthContext.tsx`.
    - `AuthContext.tsx` now manages `currentUser` state and `isUserLoading` state, fetching user data directly when a session is active and `apiService` is configured.
    - `UserContext.tsx` is simplified, focusing on non-authentication-related user state like `isClockedIn`.
    - Components consuming `currentUser` (e.g., `app/job/[id].tsx`) were updated to use `useAuth()`.
    - This architectural change resolves previous race conditions related to user data fetching and API readiness signaling.
    - The `isApiConfigured` flag in `AuthContext.tsx` (with deferred setting) remains to ensure proper timing for `apiService` token configuration before the fetch.
- **Comment Item UI Update:**
    - Modified `components/job/CommentItem.tsx` to replace text-based edit/delete buttons with smaller, iconic `MaterialIcons` buttons (`edit`, `delete`).
    - Ensured icons use appropriate theme-aware colors.
    - Resolved associated TypeScript errors by correcting `User` type import and using `buttonVariants.error` for delete icon color.
- **Job Cancellation Dialog UI Update (in `components/job/JobStatus.tsx`):**
    - Adjusted button layout for "Go Back" and "Cancel Job" to be space-between justified (left/right alignment).
    - Updated "Go Back" button to a standard `OutlinedButton` for neutral styling.
    - Ensured "Cancel Job" (destructive) button retains its error styling.
    - Removed full-width properties from individual buttons in the dialog.
- **Comments Section Refactor:**
    - Extracted comments functionality from `app/job/[id].tsx` into a new dedicated component: `components/job/JobComments.tsx`.
    - This new component now manages its own state, handlers, and JSX for displaying comments, the comment modal, and related actions.
    - `app/job/[id].tsx` has been simplified by removing the direct comments logic and now renders the `JobComments` component.

## What's Left to Build

- **Refine `systemPatterns.md`:**
    - Verify API communication details by reviewing `utils/api.ts`.
    - Confirm styling approach by inspecting component files.
    - Detail offline support strategy if any.
    - Verify HOC usage.
    - Detail API error handling and form handling patterns by reviewing relevant code.
    - Verify the exact screen for listing jobs.
- **Refine `techContext.md`:**
    - Specify Node.js version if a strict requirement exists.
    - Detail any specific IDE extensions or configurations beyond standard ESLint.
    - Clarify minimum OS version support if known.
    - Document performance targets or known limitations.
    - List any critical constraints from the backend API.
- **Populate `Known Issues`:** Document any existing bugs or known problems with the application.
- **Populate `Evolution of Project Decisions`:** As major decisions are made or changed, document them here.
- Continuously update all Memory Bank files, especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`, as the project evolves and new information becomes available.

## Current Status

- Memory Bank core files have been initialized and populated with initial project information.
- Further refinement and detail are needed in several sections, particularly `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`, requiring code review and potentially more specific user input.
- The Memory Bank provides a foundational understanding of the project.
