## NPM Scripts

`yarn start` - starts expo dev server, can pass `--android`, `--ios`, `--web` to build for single environment

`expo run:android` - test app outside of expo managed service on Android platform

`expo run:ios` - test app outside of expo managed service on iOS platform

`yarn ios` - starts local development build for iOS

`yarn android` - starts local development build for Android

`yarn test` - runs Jest unit tests

## .env config
`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` - URL of Phoenix backend

`EXPO_PUBLIC_GEOCODING_API_KEY` - Google Maps API key

`EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Authorize.net public key

`EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZE_LOGIN_ID` - Authorize.net login ID

## Simulator Builds (iOS)

In order to run the app on iOS simulators, follow these instructions:

1. Install XCode from the App Store (if you haven't already)
2. 'yarn build:simulator' to create a new simulator build (this is required if you are changing eas.json config, but otherwise you can skip this step)
3. 'yarn build:run' to install a simulator build, you select it from the list of available builds after running the command

Note: This works for Android as wel, but you will have to check package.json and modify the scripts accordingly.


### Troubleshooting Tips

- Windows Users: if Axios requests aren't working, use ngrok tunnel for `phoenix` backend API because there may be networking issues without it.

- Sometimes issues can be caused by cache, to clear cache with expo: `yarn start --clear`

- An .env file is required with a single property `API_URL` that points to Phoenix backend

- Sometimes issues can be caused by cache, to clear cache with expo running the following command `yarn start --clear`

  Note: Refer to Expo documentation on clearing cache for your development environment:

  https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/clear-cache-macos-linux/

  https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/clear-cache-windows/

- **ANDROID**: For local development builds to work you need JDK 11 installed and `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set to JDK 11 path
- **IOS**: For local development builds to work you need XCode installed


### Bundler Cache Issues

If you are having unexpected issues, you may need to clear the bundler cache. To do so, run the following commands:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules ios android
yarn cache clean
yarn
watchman watch-del-all
rm -fr $TMPDIR/haste-map-*
rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-cache
```
